# ♠️ Blackjack Card Game Engine 🎮

A fully functional **Blackjack game engine** built in Java using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This console-based implementation simulates a real Blackjack game between a player and the dealer, complete with card dealing, scoring logic, and winner determination.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I created this project as a **personal challenge** to solidify my understanding of **core OOP concepts** in Java such as:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

Instead of just reading theory, I wanted to apply these concepts in a fun and interactive way — and what better way than building a game?
